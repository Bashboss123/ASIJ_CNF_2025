        <h2>What is Creative Non-Fiction?</h2>
        <p>
          Creative Non-Fiction (CNF) is a genre that merges literary techniques
          with factual storytelling. Rather than present reality as a series of
          raw facts, CNF writers borrow techniques of fiction writing—
          description, anecdote, scene construction, characterization, and
          dialogue—to tell dynamic and compelling true stories. The crucial
          distinction between creative nonfiction and fiction is that nonfiction
          purports to tell the truth with very little embellishment, while
          fiction claims to be “made up.” Creative nonfiction also draws from
          poetic approaches to language, including imagery, metaphor, tone, and
          shifts in point of view and perspective.

        <h2>SUPA Creative Non-Fiction at ASIJ</h2>
        <p>
          Syracuse University Project Advance (SUPA) Creative Nonfiction is a
          year-long English course at the American School in Japan that immerses
          students in the art of storytelling through real-life experiences.
          Students read and analyze a diverse range of creative nonfiction texts
          while crafting their own essays, experimenting with voice, style,
          form, and research to deepen their writing. In the Publication Unit,
          each student contributes a piece to the collective anthology Komorebi,
          showcasing their unique perspective and growth as writers.
