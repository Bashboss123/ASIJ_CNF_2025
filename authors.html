                            <p>Like the dappled sunlight that filters through leaves, creating ever-shifting patterns on the ground, my memories of Hawaii dance between clarity and shadow. Each morning light in both locations represents a fleeting moment that can never be fully captured, only experienced and remembered. The story's detailed attention to these ephemeral moments mirrors the Japanese appreciation for Komorebi, where beauty is found not just in the light itself, but in its transient nature. Just as Komorebi creates a momentary interplay between light and shadow that can never be exactly replicated, I hope my attempts to preserve memories of Hawaiian mornings through words become their own kind of filtered light – transformed and refracted through the leaves of time and distance. </p>

                            <p>I resisted, hesitated, and eventually grew into it. Through the symbolism of The Giving Tree, The Very Hungry Caterpillar, and Green Eggs and Ham I explored how the people around me, especially my mother, guided me in the beginning stages of my musical journey, even when I did not realize it. She was the steady presence, always giving and always patient, while I was the hesitant learner, slowly opening up to something new. Writing this piece helped me see that growth is not just about personal effort. It is shaped by those who support us even in the smallest and quietest ways.</p>

                            <p>In my piece "Branches of the mind", I approach the Komorebi provacation through a philisophical and psychological lense, covering themes of mindfullness. To do so, I create an analogy of Komorebi to our minds. That is, I compare the Komorebi (sunglight penetrating and leaking through leaves) to how the constant stimulation of today's modern age shields our minds from wandering and the formation of novel insights. In the analogy, the leaves represent the stimulus that prevents the light from leaking through. Furthermore, the light represents the new thoughts.</p>

                            <p>For me, Komorebi is the idea that no two people experience a moment in the exact same way. When light filters through the leaves of a tree, no two people see the same shifting patterns- the experience is unique to each individual. Similarly, my piece captures these fleeting moments of Komorebi throughout my road trip across Hokkaido. After failing to capture one of these moments in a photo, I realize that the true value of these experiences lies in being fully present for them.</p>

                            <p>Komorebi, the light shining through the leaves, meant to me the light and the darkness, the bittersweet feeling of change. For me, my brother's departure to college was a komorebi experience - a time marked by both the pain of his absence and the realization of my own potential. Initially, his leaving was a big pain for me, though it took long to notice. But as the weeks turned into months, the sting began to lessen, and the shafts of light pierced through the darkness. I discovered a strength I didn't know I possessed, and my independence bloomed through his absence. This piece is my attempt to capture that journey, the complex tapestry of emotions woven from longing and growth. It is a message to others facing similar experiences: that while a sibling leaving can be a significant change, it can also be an opportunity for self-discovery, a chance to step out of their shadow and be your own sunlight.</p>

                            <p>Komorebi is reflected in my piece through the theme of fleeting moments. Much like sunlight filtering through leaves, casting patterns that shift and fade in an instant, adapting to change is a transient experience. I explored the emotions that one may feel in the journey of self-discovery—particularly the complexities of navigating one's identity between two cultures. The constantly changing environment shapes how one sees themselves, creating a sense of both confusion and transformation. That feeling is only temporary.</p>

                            <p>To me, Komorebi is about the beauty and impact of short-lived moments. I tried to utilize images and comic panels to 
        bring out and enhance the feelings that I had trouble incorporating into my writing. I wanted to show the reader what a big part 
        of my life Pokemon is and where my passion stemmed from. My writing is all about the impact that a short, seemingly 
        insignificant moment from my childhood had on me, and how it shaped the rest of my youth as well as how it has 
        affected me in the present. </p>

                            <p>To me, Komorebi mainly meant nostalgia, or more specifically, my childhood memories. The main inspiration behind my piece was the album Life, by The Cardigans as my mom would often play their songs, and more specifically, songs from that album as I grew up. This led me to writing my piece on little snippets of my childhood memories, tying each song on the side A of the album to a memory. I'm really happy with how my piece turned out, as well as this provocation unit, it's become a way for me to reflect on my childhood and how its shaped me to who I am today.</p>

                            <p>Winning my first tournament is the most unforgettable moment of my high school years so far. It is one of the few times in my tennis journey when I truly felt proud of myself—the first time that I felt my hard work was recognized by others and most importantly, myself. In that moment, the world seemed to mirror the interplay of light and shadow. Like komorebi, victory—fleeting, rare, yet radiant—was finally able to filter through the darkness of exhaustion, doubt, and years of struggle. To me, it was not just a win but a reflection of the delicate balance between despair and hope, confidence and uncertainty, that had defined my path. It was a reminder that triumph can always emerge, and through this story, I hope to capture its fleeting beauty and what it takes to reach it.</p>

My piece reflects this delicate balance, illuminating how even the heaviest moments of defeat, grief, and change cast shadows that allow light to break through. Whether it’s the sting of a football loss, the ache of my grandfather’s absence, or the quiet triumph of a mountain summit, each experience holds both weight and warmth. Like sunlight filtering through the branches, these events shape me, casting patterns I can only fully appreciate when I step back and see them as part of a greater whole.</p>

In my story, I talk about the different things in life, mostly my family members, and how they shape who I am. In each paragraph, I talk about a new person in my family and connect it to how those little things impacted me. At the end, I talk about myself, and how these things in my life shaped myself. There is not really a creative way that I wrote my piece so technically you can interpret it in any way you want.</p>

                            <p>The term Komorebi reminds me of the warmth and trust my parents gave me, always guiding me like rays of sunlight breaking through the branches. However, I learned that anyone, no matter how good they seem, have hints of darkness, deception and betrayal. This story is about the first time I was ever betrayed, which was by my very own parents in kindergarten. Though it was a minor incident, it taught me that I couldn’t trust anyone. I was blinded by the light until I came across the darkness.

                            <p>In my mind, Komorebi represents how love lingers even when a presence fades—how light finds its way through the deepest holes of grief. My piece reflects this: the warmth of my grandfather’s embrace, the laughter shared in a spinning blur of colors, the quiet ache of absence, and the unexpected glow of rediscovered connection. Like Komorebi, these moments are brief, slipping through my fingers like light through leaves, yet they leave marks on my heart, shaping how I see the world. In the spaces between loss and longing, between past and present, I find the soft illumination of family—never gone, only shifting, always there.</p>

                            <p>Once the provocation was explained to me, the word komorebi and its meaning truly resonated with me. I loved how this single word evoked such nostalgia and happiness. For my piece, I chose to write about a series of joyful memories that often flash through my mind from a hot summer day a few years ago. That entire day was filled with laughter and love, and since most of these moments took place during sunset in a dense Japanese forest, I felt it was the perfect memory to share in this book.</p>

                            <p>Light filters through the spaces we don’t always think to look — between leaves, between moments, between what is here and what is gone. My piece lingers in that in-between, where warmth and loss coexist, where sunlight tries to touch even the quietest, forgotten corners. To me, Komorebi is more than just the way light moves; it is the way memory does too — casting patterns, shifting with time, illuminating what was always there. In my childhood backyard, life and remembrance intertwined, the golden glow of summer days resting just as gently on weathered gravestones as it did on the leaves above. This piece is my take on that duality — on the way light does not erase shadows, but instead, makes them part of the story.</p>

                            <p>Komorebi to me embodies juxtaposition. Sun and shadow, nostalgia and remorse, hope and futility. It's a universal experience which I experienced during a major peak in my life. Initially steeped in jubilation, I soon found myself reflecting on the last few years with a degree of remorse. I capture this interplay of contrasting emotion in a recount of a mountain jog I went on over the winter break.</p>

A vivid, humorous example is my friend—who had little interest in music—growing exhausted while I was completely immersed, losing all sense of time. What felt like minutes was actually an hour. I also added “intricate” to the title, aligning with Komorebi’s notion of finding beauty in small things. My story emphasizes the tangible and detailed nature of records—holding them reveals nuances easily missed on a phone. Though playing them is a slow, meticulous process, each step carries its own wonder.

                            <p>Komorebi expresses the contrast between two things, that is, the juxtaposition of light and dark. It’s about balance—dancing between control and chaos, serenity and nerves. My piece, Between Breaths, reflects the still light that pierces through moments of doubt and confidence, bringing clarity and peace in the face of tension. Each section of my writing zooms in on the conflict occurring moments before performing my routine, where every breath mirrors the rhythm of my journey—moments of uncertainty are followed by moments of steady control. The internal push and pull of fear and focus coexist, guiding me through the chaos of the competition. This perfectly balanced negotiation between vulnerability and strength is what makes the performance possible.</p>

"Komorebi" reminds me of my childhood with my siblings, where we were occupied by simple beauty. Blissful and curious, we found happiness in each other, our mother and grandmother, and the natural world that extended just beyond the window. My piece reflects both the dappled shadows of Kuhombutsu Temple on our living room wall and the bittersweetness of our gradual parting from our shadow puppets and each other.</p>

                            <p>Komorebi epitomizes the transient nature of remembering something, much like how light dances through tree leaves. For me, this provocation means that even as our memories fades, just like daylight, our past weaves their way into the present and illuminates the pathway ahead of us. In writing this piece, I reflected my childhood, when each moment seemed eternal - the sun gently warmed my skin as I raced my siblings under the boundless sky. Just as light does interesting things to the shapes of shadows, reflecting on these cherished memories allowed me to see glimpses of forgotten joys. In exploring these recollections, I have re-discovered shadows of the universe I once knew where, I spent moments with my family, immersed in the simple wonders of nature. Komorebi reminds me that even as time dilutes these memories, the light of these experiences never fails to flicker in my mind, guiding me back to who I really am.</p>

The piece is divided into sections marked by the definition of different aspects of experiences. Komorebi beautifully ties together my life experiences, blurring the line between the events that stay in my memory and the more ordinary moments that get forgotten over time---the key to komorebi is the continuous sequence of experiences and the sentiments drawn from living in the given moment.</p>

I decided to focus on my experience with growth for this anthology, specifically through moments of my life when I felt I gained something but also lost something notable. Connecting to our provocation Komorebi, I also made sure to emphasize the contrast between light and shadow, the two sides of growth.</p>

                            <p>To me, Komorebi symbolizes the beauty in little things, the fleeting moments, and the idea of nothing lasts forever. Each baked treat is unique, existing only once, and it’s the little things, like sharing it with others, that make it special. Just as light dances between leaves, baking brings flashes of joy, connection, and resilience, illuminating the relationships that shape me. My piece reflects how each recipe, like Komorebi, captures a quick but meaningful moment. Whether it's the quiet understanding between my sister and me as we experiment with matcha brownies, the unspoken love exchanged through shared treats, or the resilience I build through failed macarons. Baking, like light, is impermanent, yet it lingers in memory, warming the heart long after the last bite.</p>

The light of hope. The light to keep going. When I first heard the meaning of Komorebi, the faces of the most important people in my life came to mind.  The “trees” symbolize different challenges in my life, while the “sunlight” represents my three siblings who give light to my life. In this way, I feel like “Komorebi” is the perfect illustration of what my siblings mean to me. Their support and comfort during tough times make my life feel brighter and so much more meaningful. I wanted to dedicate this piece, "Once in a Lifetime,” to them and showcase a more sentimental, touching side of sibling relationships.</p>

The story “Mortality” explores the fleeting nature of time spent with loved ones. I realize our mortality and impermanence are actually what makes these moments so special and worth living. The story “Longing” delves deep into the indescribable feeling of longing that arises whenever I star-gaze with someone. Struggling to understand this feeling for years, while stargazing on the snowy nighttime slope with my friends, I finally understand it. I longed for…</p>

                            <p>Komorebi, to me, is not just sunlight leaking through the leaves—it's the fleeting warmth of a treasured memory, the quiet glow of a moment unnoticed until it's already gone. In my piece, the chaos of my dog's puppyhood becomes a reflection of how love is not just in grand gestures but in the smallest, messiest acts of care. Her antics, once tests of patience, became daily affirmations of devotion, teaching me that love is often found in the unglamorous and the routine. Just as light shifts and dances before disappearing, those mornings slipped away before I could grasp their weight. No matter how hard I try, those moments can never be fully recreated, like the sunlight filtering through the leaves.</p>

                            <p>The term Komorebi officially refers to the fleeting beauty of light passing through leaves, but to me, it means much more. When writing A Trial by Physics, I drew from Komorebi’s core elements—ephemerality, lasting impact beyond the moment, and, most importantly, the parts of a tree—to tell one of my favorite stories. George S. Patton once said, “A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan next week.” The moment I describe unfolded over just twenty minutes, yet its impact has stayed with me for years. Komorebi is neither perfect nor meticulously planned, yet it leaves a lasting impression. There’s nothing quite like it.</p>

Komorebi describes a scene of flickering light shifting each second in the blink of an eye as the branches move and the light moves along. My piece explores what we lose to the passage of time. What are the ordinary instances we will remember when it is no longer the norm? I string small vignettes to replicate bursts of memories from childhood, reminiscing on a time that will never return.</p>

My story delves into a week of my life where I travelled thousands of miles to Costa Rica and met 15 other students. The whole experience felt short-lived and ephemeral, but the deep connections that I formed with the environment and my peers created memories that would last forever, similar to Komorebi.</p>

                            <p>Occasionally, looking through the window of my house or car, a glimpse of light flickers within the trees. I almost always feel a sense of nostalgia that washes over me as I feel the warmth from the contrast of the sun with the cool slivers of shade. In this anthology, my essay evokes a sense of hope; light that forms in the shadows. My essay, '1624' relates to the provocation of "Komorebi" since it correlates to my thoughts of the shadows and brings out the light of the present. This is the perfect balance carrying the beauty and significance to our lives, and it can determine what amazing possibilities await us in our future.</p>

Only existing then.

I used to have this doll with me wherever I went, but as I grew older, I stopped having it around, and eventually, it ended up in my storage closet. Even though I don't have it with me anymore, I keep it due to the memories I have with it. The piece reflects on the fond memories I have of it and the change in the affection I have towards the doll. Komorebi, to me, means fleeting, ephemeral moments, and I believe that the piece having numerous short snippets of different memories fits the theme.</p>

                            <p>Crafting the idea for my piece for me took a while. When I heard the description of Komorebi, the words that stood out to me the most were “Fleeting experiences.” I thought about moments in my life that were fleeting and combined that with the idea of this beautiful image that sunlight through leaves creates, and I was left with the idea of the goodbye hug. What stood out to me about the goodbye hug was that it gives me a really nice canvas for displaying raw emotion as goodbye hugs are the most vulnerable and expressive way to share a goodbye, something that is already packed full of sentiment. Sunlight through leaves causes shimmering beams, but it also creates shadows, and I feel that was the part that really molded my story to Komorebi.</p>

It clings to moments through the flicker of sunlight through trees, the weight of a suitcase on uneven ground or the echo of laughter carried by the fresh summer air. Nostalgia isn’t just remembering. It's also reliving, looping through time. It's special hold on the way the world felt in a single, quiet sigh. 
        
        You think you’ll remember it all, but memory softens at the edges, keeping the feeling but losing the details. So you write it down. Not only to preserve the past, but to make it forever. To return, as many times as you want, to the scent of greenery, the quiet hum of life, and most of all, the peace of it all. </p>

Just as light dances through the gaps, moments of my childhood flicker in and out of my mind—Christmas mornings, laughter filled sleepovers, and quiet reflections in hidden corners of the city. Tokyo has been both my shelter and my foundation, a place where I have grown, struggled, and found comfort in the familiar. But just as light shifts with time, I, too, must move forward, stepping out from the shelter of my past into the unknown. Though the future is uncertain, I know that Tokyo’s light will always find its way through, illuminating my path, reminding me of where I come from, and reassuring me that home is never truly left behind.</p>

In my writing, the peeling of oranges is a metaphor for these moments—revealing memories of comfort, old habits, and childhood innocence. Like how sunlight through trees creates shifting patterns of light and shadow, life’s rituals hold bittersweet contrasts, like joy and longing, sweetness and regret. Reflecting on these rituals reminds me to cherish these ordinary, ephemeral moments in my everyday life.</p>

Just as komorebi highlights the changing patterns of light and shadow, my bath serves as a space where I notice the passage of time, from childhood memories to my present understanding of belonging. Writing this piece helped me realize how something as simple as bathing can carry cultural and personal significance, shaping how I reconnect with my Japanese heritage in my daily life.</p>

        It's a term to appreciate nature, to appreciate the innocent and the light, to notice the shadows. In my piece, I go through a special place from my childhood -- named Matsubayashi. As each season passes by, I use the metaphorical shadow and light to show my change in emotions and comfortability as I get used to the environment little by little. I also include subtle changes in descriptions to show the differences between the seasons. It's a story about change, fitting in, and contrast.</p>

This was tied to stories about when I was in the moment and appreciating each moment. I interpreted Komorebi both literally, with the tree analogy, and metaphorically through my short stories. I especially tapped into the aspect of Komorebi happening at a specific moment in time, which I used to develop stories that were unique at that moment.</p>

Yet when intertwined, like Komorebi—the delicate interplay of sunlight filtering through leaves—they create something unexpectedly beautiful. This essence of contradiction inspired my piece, Between Two Hands. Mom and Dad, two pieces meant to fit together, but in my life, they never have. And yet, within this paradox, I discovered my own definition of beauty, a deeper understanding of what it truly means to have a family. With this one train ride between my dad’s and my mom’s house, I uncovered a new perspective on family. One shaped not by a perfect union, but by the meaning I found in between.</p>

                            <p>Komorebi has always been my favorite Japanese word. To me, it symbolizes the persistence of beauty and goodness—sunlight coming through leaves and shadows, just as things to be grateful for are always present, even on our most difficult days. In my piece "Another Day", I wanted to capture how simple, everyday beauty can break through our spirals of cynicism—if only we pay attention—and remind us that each day is something precious to be cherished.</p>

                            <p>The piece 'Perfect Daughter' is written about the past few years of my life and a reflection on how the good and bad days have shaped who I am now as I prepare to leave my current life for university. I describe the good and bad days as lights and shadows of my life, qualities noticed in Komorebi. With this, I emphasize the idea that light would not shine as brightly without the shadow, and the shadow only feels so dark in contrast with light. In other words, the good days can only be good with bad days to compare to, but the bad only seems so bad because we've had better days. Life and growing are about embracing both the good and bad days and allowing experiences to navigate who you grow to be.</p>

In my piece, I explore how simple daily rituals—lighting incense, pouring coffee, taking morning showers—offer me tranquility in the midst of chaos, much like sunlight filtering through leaves. I learned these rituals from my family: incense from my brother, coffee from my mother, and morning showers from my father. When I felt overwhelmed or mentally hazy, these habits became moments of clarity, helping me reset and prepare for future challenges.</p>

In my story, the radiance beneath the bright 'pineapple rays' on the fields explores the literal meaning of Komorebi, with the fleeting nature of pineapple picking and consumption representing the figurative aspects of picking pineapples. For me, Komorebi means embracing the lasting moments amidst a fast-paced environment where everything feels fleeting, from memories to interactions. Dissecting each part of the pineapple down from the crown to the seeds was my way of redefining what that summer meant for me and how it influenced my worldview. My memories of the pineapple scent, lessons from cooking with pineapples, and leading my family in times of social distress highlight the lasting impressions I have extracted from experiences that span mere seconds. Writing this story not only helped me reflect on my past work but also cemented my interest in leading my community through times of distress.</p>

                            <p>Komorebi: the way sunlight filters through the trees, shifting and flickering but never fully disappearing mirrors the way certain people remain with us, even after they’ve moved on. This piece is about how the cicada’s short-lived adult phase reflects the fleeting nature of Komorebi, the brief yet beautiful moments of light and life that pass through us. The empty cicada shell, like a hollow outline of what once was, symbolizes the unseen influences that shape us. My piece explores this through Leah, whose absence isn’t just an emptiness but a quiet presence woven into familiar places, routines, and memories. Like the exuviae of a cicada clinging to the bark, she is both here and not, lingering in the spaces we once shared. Komorebi is the light that dances between presence and absence, reminding us that what once was still leaves traces behind. My story reflects on change, on the way friendships shift, grief reshapes, and time carries us forward, yet some connections never fully fade.</p>

I felt it aligned well with the provocation because, although the physical pain and the experience of taking an MRI was horrible, the situation also led to some unexpected positive outcomes. For example, getting a good laugh with my friends and learning to have an open mindset. This reflected the concept of komorebi, the light that shines through the darkness, reflecting how even in tough moments, there can be moments of light and growth.</p>

I tried to reflect on the idea of how these moments aren't forever, how they show a time of innocence. As Komorebi refers to light and shadow, my piece shows the light in fun memories but shadows when realizing they are in the past and forever gone.</p>

To me, Komorebi represents short moments in time that I remember for the rest of my life. The beautiful scenery, the small things at that moment, the sounds, the light, and everything else. I hope after reading my story, you feel the moment that I felt and remember the moment I remember.</p>
